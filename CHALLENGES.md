# Challenges Faced During Development

## 1. Hugging Face API Integration Issues

### Challenge
- Encountered intermittent HTTP 503 Service Unavailable errors when making requests to the Hugging Face API
- This caused reliability issues in document classification

### Solution & Future Improvements
- For production deployment, running the model locally on a dedicated server would eliminate API dependency
- Consider implementing a fallback model for when API is unavailable

## 2. Deployment and Resource Constraints

### Challenge
- Initial attempt to deploy ML model locally faced significant resource constraints
- Model size and computational requirements were too demanding for standard deployment

### Solution & Future Improvements
- Migrated to Hugging Face API as a temporary solution
- For future scaling, consider:
  - Model optimization techniques (quantization, pruning)
  - Using cloud infrastructure with GPU support
  - Implementing model compression techniques
  - Using smaller, optimized models

## 3. ML Classification Accuracy Issues

### Challenge
- Zero-shot classification not providing expected categorization accuracy
- Categories not always matching document content accurately

### Solution & Future Improvements
For improving zero-shot classification accuracy:

1. **Model Improvements**:
   - Test different zero-shot classification models
   - Consider fine-tuning on a small labeled dataset (few-shot learning)
   - Implement ensemble methods combining multiple models

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Improve document text extraction
   - Implement better text cleaning and normalization
   - Extract key sections or summaries for classification

3. **Hybrid Approach**:
   - Combine zero-shot with traditional classification methods
   - Implement confidence thresholds
   - Use rule-based systems for high-confidence cases

## Additional Challenges

1. **Document Processing**:
   - Handling various document formats
   - Extracting clean text from PDFs and other formats
   - Maintaining document structure during processing

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Processing time for large documents
   - Text chunking implementation for better classification
